## Project setup

If you haven't logged into the github package repository, you'll need to run:

```bash
npm login --repository https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

If you're using 2FA, you'll need to create a Personal Access Token with all the `repo:` and `read:packages` scopes.
This will be your password when prompted.

After that is taken care of, you can just run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
